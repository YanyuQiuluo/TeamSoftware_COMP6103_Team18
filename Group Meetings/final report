1. Teamwork (Weighting - 30%)

For teamwork, we want to understand
● How you organised your team and what tools were used.
frontend: HTML and CSS
backend: Node JS
Database: first we decide to use MySQL because "Arwa" who was in charge of database structure has some experience with MySQL
            then we decide to switch to MongoDB for more easily SQL structure.


● How the team communicated throughout the project and ensured members
were carried along.
the team members meet twice a week. before each meeting we discuss what each of us will work on. then at the meeting we work together
to solve any difficulties.

● The balance of contributions from team members during the project iterations.
frontend:
backend:
Database: Arwa
Documentation: Arwa
Test:
    - write test cases: Arwa
    - execute test cases:
    -writing test results:

To assess this, the following will be reviewed
● Final team report
● Team supervisory meeting notes
● Feedback from the client meetings
● GitLab commits

2. Documentation (Weighting - 40%)

With this criterion, we want to evaluate
● how your team carried out its projects
● how you adequately describe/present the solution developed to the client -
including how it could be used in your absence.
A large part of the team documentation mark will be based on the quality of your team
report, the extent to which it details all the requested information, including changes to
stories and basic information about using your system.
Team documentation will be graded using a number of mediums which include
● Final team report
● User guide
● Setup guide (how can the client set up the software developed?)
● Test results
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Delivered Software (Weighting - 30%)

With this criterion, we want to evaluate how well your delivered software meets the
requirements specified.
Particularly, we are interested in answering the following questions
● How usable is the product?
● Does it meet the client’s requirements?
● Is the product developed to specification?
The software will be graded using a number of mediums some of which include
○ The basic organisation of your code into units, and its overall structure
○ The amount of work completed to date, and the extent to which you are on
track to delivering a good quality product
○ Client feedback on the quality of the product
○ Basic functional test of the product
○ Walkthrough video
Each team is required to produce a 3-minute video walkthrough of their software
showing various functionalities developed. This must be added to a ‘/video’ folder of
your team’s GitLab repository and you should provide a link to it in the report.
