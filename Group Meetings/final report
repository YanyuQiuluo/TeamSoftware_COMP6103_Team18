1. Teamwork (Weighting - 30%)
For teamwork, we want to understand
● How you organised your team and what tools were used.
frontend: HTML and CSS
backend: Node JS
Database: first we decide to use MySQL because "Arwa" who was in charge of database structure has some experience with MySQL
            then we decide to switch to MongoDB for more easily SQL structure.


● How the team communicated throughout the project and ensured members
were carried along.
the team members meet twice a week. before each meeting we discuss what each of us will work on. then at the meeting we work together
to solve any difficulties.

● The balance of contributions from team members during the project iterations.
frontend:
backend:
Database: Arwa

To assess this, the following will be reviewed
● Final team report
● Team supervisory meeting notes
● Feedback from the client meetings
● GitLab commits
